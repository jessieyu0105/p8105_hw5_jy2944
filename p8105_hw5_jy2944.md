Problem 1
=========

### Import and tidy data

``` r
# Start with a dataframe containing all file names: `list.files()`
study_df = tibble(file_names = list.files(path = "./data")) %>% 
  # Use `map()` to iterate over file names and read in data for each subject, and save the results in a new variable `data`
  mutate(data = map(.x = str_c("./data/", file_names), 
                    ~ read.csv(.x))) %>% 
  unnest() %>%
  # Begin Tidy
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  # remove str ".csv" in variable `file_names`
  mutate(file_names = str_replace(file_names, ".csv", "")) %>% 
  # manipulate file names to include study arm and subject ID
  separate(file_names, into = c("group", "subject_id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  # gather weekly observations
  gather(key = "week", value = "subject_data", week_1:week_8) %>% 
  mutate(
    # remove str "week_" in variable `week`
    week = str_replace(week, "week_", ""),
    subject_id = as.integer(subject_id),
    week = as.integer(week)
  )
```
